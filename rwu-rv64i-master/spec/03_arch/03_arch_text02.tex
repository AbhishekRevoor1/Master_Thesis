An "activation signal" will be generated synchronously with the "system clock" by its rising edge (green). This results in a delayed generation of the rising edge of the "activation signal". With the next rising edge of the "system clock" (red), the "activation signal" will be removed. Also here, the falling edge of the "activation signal" will have a small delay to the clock. So, the "activation signal" is exactly on "system clock" period high. This pair of signals can now be taken to start a following device (e.g. a counter), the counter will count only when the activation signal is high and the system clock will show a rising edge (red).
