\textcolor{red}{This section should describe the product specific instantiation of this moduleâ€™s feature set (which may be a subset of the full feature set). It is intended also for use in the product overview section of the target spec/summary target spec.}

The standard features of a ALU peripheral are described in its functional description in Section \ref{subsec:alufunc01}. Generic features, that can be decided for each specific instantiation of the peripheral are listed and completed for ALU0 in Table \ref{tab:asAluPer02}.

The \aschip \, has only one ALU.
