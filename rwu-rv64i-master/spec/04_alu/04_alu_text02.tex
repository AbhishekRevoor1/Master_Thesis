The following table \ref{tab:asAluPer02} lists all hardware interfaces which are relevant for the regular operation of the device. It is not a detailed list of all signals and does not include implementation specific informations.

\textcolor{red}{The names used below show the functional connectivity. There is no guarantee that they are electrically compatible (e.g. voltage levels, clock domains etc. may be different). A full list is part of the design spec.}
