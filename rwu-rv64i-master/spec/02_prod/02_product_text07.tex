Europractice 90\,nm technology.

Infineonâ€™s 90\,nm (70\,nm physical gate length) CMOS technology is designed for digital
and analog circuit design. It offers advanced possibilities for low power design (triple
well, low leakage transistor types). The technology has 4-9 layers of copper metallization.
It offers an increase in peak performance of more than 50\% and a reduction of active
power consumption of more than a factor of 2. Compared to the predecessor technology
twice the cell density for standard cells can be achieved in L90.

The nominal core voltage is 1.2\,V, IO devices have a nominal supply voltage of 2.5\,V or
1.8\,V.
