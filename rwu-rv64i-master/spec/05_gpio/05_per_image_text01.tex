The image block (aslisaimage\_e) maps the sine oscillation to the RGB output (red\_o, green\_o, blue\_o). This is done by means of the information got from the vga unit. The vga unit delivers the timing of a VGA frame, the sine unit delivers the amplitudes and timing of a sine oscillation.

The sine oscillation will generate a trigger at a programmable amplitude level. This trigger starts the collection of a sine.
