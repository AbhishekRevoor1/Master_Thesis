Originally a terabyte (TB) is $1.099.511.627.776 bytes = 2^{40} bytes = 1 \cdot 1024 \cdot 1024 \cdot 1024 \cdot 1024 byte$. In table \ref{tab:hennpatt01} it is compared to the newer, marketing oriented, tarabyte on the base of powers ot ten ,$10^{12} = 1.000.000.000.000$. One can earn more money with this newer definition. The new name for the old definition is now tebibyte (TiB).
